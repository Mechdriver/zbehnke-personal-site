              I was raised around computers. My dad was a programmer and would constantly work and play with them throughout my childhood.
              My early experiences with computers involved videogames. I loved point and cick adventure games and whatever retro games my dad could emulate on his machines.

              I knew what programming was thanks to the Foxtrot and Dilbert comics that I would read obessively. I really wanted
              to learn C++ but I could not find the proper resources to teach myself. Even though I was motivated to learn, I found programming textbooks daunting.

              In the middle of highschool my family moved to California. I was still playing videogames and just started learning about weightlifting from my dad.
              I asked him to teach me after I saw 'Wolverine Origins'. I was the family's IT person at this point. Fixing simple hardware and software problems was challenging and fun to me.

              As I was applying to colleges I knew that I wanted to work with computers. I wanted to program them. I applied early to Cal Poly SLO for Software Engineering.
              After a few months of anticipation I was accepted.

              Before I left for college I decided to teach myself some programming. I discovered Python and attempted to write a small text based adventure game.
              Python is still one of my favorite languages and it is my top choice for projects and scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
              In college, programming did not come easy to me. Coming from a homeschooled background the structure and deadlines were hard to get used to. I was also
              addicted to socialized. I could always find someone to talk to about my interests and it was amazing to be around people of the same mindset.
