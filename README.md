This is now deprecated. The new version of this project is [here](https://github.com/Mechdriver/zbehnke-serverless-personal-site).

# Overview of Behnke.codes
Live site is at [Behnke.codes](https://behnke.codes).  
I used this project to become familiar with building a website from scratch.  
As modern web development goes, a lot of time was spent reseraching what tools and frameworks I wanted to use.  

### Frameworks and Libraries
* Frontend
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/)
* Backend
  * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

### Build Tools
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### Hosting Service
Behnke.codes is hosted using [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now).  

### Wepack notes
npm run build runs Webpack in production mode, which minimizes the bundle file automatically

npm run dev runs the Webpack in the watch mode.
